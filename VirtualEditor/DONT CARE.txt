Good ideas:

 setSize should also recalculate mass.
SetSize should recalculate mass using a density (default 1).

Set Density should be implemented.

inversemass = 1 / (area * density).  density of 0 is special case where object is immobile.



Game idea: create a course of very massive objects, try to reach goal as rocket as fast as possible.
