CONFIRM

is the boundary thing going to be alright?


are you SURE you have the correct moments of inertia?

rocket has flames, which are non-physical.  the center of mass is affected by its head being more dense.
station is incredibly massive, but its dome is above the world so it has no collision detection.

increasing size increases mass

the world bounds are always the edge of the screen to help with experimentation







Game idea: create a course of very massive objects, try to reach goal as rocket as fast as possible.

DON'T CARE
possibly fix phypolygon halfspace to work on rhombuses.  oh gosh why.
fix composite halfspace, like station.
why not one resizer for phypolygon, which calculates center of mass, area, etc?
