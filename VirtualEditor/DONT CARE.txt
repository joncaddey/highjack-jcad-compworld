TODO, in approximate order.

Make it so friends can join a network, and all join at the same time.  The friends are notified when their friends lose.  PARTY SYSTEM.  PRivate game.


Tune asteroid hp, max size, minimum fragmant size, for levels (min asteroids per level)

Make powerups.
  
add exploisions

Get composite asteroids (out of squares, triangles)

level box min number of astorids, size , 

DON'T CARE

Make asteroids out of arbitrary triangles.
Add radius to every phyobject, so it is known how far out of bounds they must go to be off screen (and loop)--just assuming max radius.  No composites, so don't care.
Get ship to fire missile, which destroys asteroid of less than 10% hp and does chain reaction explosion based on destroyed asteroids max health to nearby asteroids.
Maybe powerup can be destroyed like a bomb.
replace hp-density with regular density?
