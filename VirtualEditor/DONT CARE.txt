TODO, in approximate order.

Add radius to every phyobject, so it is known how far out of bounds they must go to be off screen (and loop)

and impulse argument to getfragments.
Spawn primative asteroids.

Tune asteroid hp as well as gun damage for levels.

Get asteroids to go to other networks.

Get composite asteroids (out of squares, triangles)

Get ship to fire bomb (clears screen)

Get ship to fire missile, which destroys asteroid of less than 10% hp and does chain reaction explosion based on destroyed asteroids max health to nearby asteroids.

OR

Make powerups.  Maybe powerup can be destroyed like a bomb.

Make asteroids out of arbitrary triangles.

ADD focus

remove thrusters when no thrust is aplied gigity

add exploisions

add sound

add score

add health bar or color to astroids

add cahin reaction eXPLOSIONS
