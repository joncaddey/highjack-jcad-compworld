Good ideas:

environment options
gravity any value
slow factor greater than 1
collisions on/off (sets the collision repeats to 0)
remove all shapes (have dialoge to confirm)

launch options
angle
power
launch button (launches selected)

fixes
set renderable of each object to null in composite
make circle go in random direction if tmp is 0.
make rocket pretty.
