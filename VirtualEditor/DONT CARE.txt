TODO, in approximate order.

// Get ship to fly around, ability to tune controls.

Get ship to mirror to other end when out of bounds.

// Get ship to fire bullets.

Spawn primative asteroids.

Make asteroids mirror to other end when out of bounds.

Tune asteroid hp as well as gun damage for levels.

Get asteroids to go to other networks.

Get ship to fire fancy bullets (first salvo is special with more pushing power, upon holding button same damage but less power.)

Get composite asteroids (out of squares, triangles)

Get ship to fire bomb (clears screen)

Get ship to fire missile, which destroys asteroid of less than 10% hp and does chain reaction explosion based on destroyed asteroids max health to nearby asteroids.
