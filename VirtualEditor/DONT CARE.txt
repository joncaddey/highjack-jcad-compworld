Good ideas:

possibly fix phypolygon halfspace to work on rhombuses.  oh gosh why.

fix rocket halfspace.  should be like rectangle, but doesn't behave that way.

do we need right-triangles?


fix composite halfspace, like station.

why not one resizer for phypolygon, which calculates center of mass, area, etc?  slower.


Game idea: create a course of very massive objects, try to reach goal as rocket as fast as possible.
