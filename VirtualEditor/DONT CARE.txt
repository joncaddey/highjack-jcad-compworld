Good ideas:

Organize PhyPolygon methods to be their own classes, each of which overrides setSize.  setSize should also recalculate mass.
SetSize should recalculate mass using a density (default 1).

Set Density should be implemented.

inversemass = 1 / (area * density).  density of 0 is special case where object is immobile.
inverseMass and inverseMomentOfInertia should be private (unless needed by resolve collision).


Game idea: create a course of very massive objects, try to reach goal as rocket as fast as possible.
