Good ideas:



do we need right-triangles?





Game idea: create a course of very massive objects, try to reach goal as rocket as fast as possible.

possibly fix phypolygon halfspace to work on rhombuses.  oh gosh why.
fix composite halfspace, like station.
why not one resizer for phypolygon, which calculates center of mass, area, etc?
