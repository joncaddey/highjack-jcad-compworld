TODO, in approximate order.


add ID to asteroid so you know who it came from.

Get asteroids to go to other networks.

Make it possible to die, restart game
Implement auto-shield.  If you get hit, your shiled will engage for a small amount of time.  This small amount of time can be lessened by manually engaging shield.


Tune asteroid hp, max size, minimum fragmant size, for levels (min asteroids per level)

add score (based on hp of destroyed asteroid?  also based on hp of _moved_ asteroid?  No score for other people's asteroids?)

Make powerups.
  
Get ship to fire bomb (clears screen)


Show "title" screen. (Card layout?)
Ask whether single or multiplayer.
REMEMBER networks previously connected to!  combo box.  (File IO)
Have randomized network id.
Assign aesthetically pleasing random color for asteroids, different from other players (helloo color chooser?)
Make relative colors, so you assign colors to other players
Have controls dialogue, similar to jon's tetris
Have controls saveable in named schemes. (File IO)
FPS drop-down

add exploisions

add sound



add chain reaction eXPLOSIONS


Get composite asteroids (out of squares, triangles)


Remove magic constants.

DON'T CARE

Make asteroids out of arbitrary triangles.
Add radius to every phyobject, so it is known how far out of bounds they must go to be off screen (and loop)--just assuming max radius.  No composites, so don't care.
Get ship to fire missile, which destroys asteroid of less than 10% hp and does chain reaction explosion based on destroyed asteroids max health to nearby asteroids.
Maybe powerup can be destroyed like a bomb.
replace hp-density with regular density?
